Points:

* What we've been teaching you (automating data analysis, using version control) is efficient *and* enables open science;

* Open Science is basically about opening up the *process* and *results* of science so that others can easily build on what youâ€™ve done.

* If you post data and source code, you must specify copyright and license.

* I Am Not A Lawyer but: copyright is *who owns it*, license is *what can non-owners do with it*.

* academic norms are: you own your data, the university owns your code.

* I suggest CC-BY for data and BSD for code; GPL is another code option.

* read [the "open science" link](http://dib-lab.github.io/2015-07-06-ucdavis/syllabus/git-04-open.html) for details on your licensing options.

* I am happy to talk at any time about this stuff.
