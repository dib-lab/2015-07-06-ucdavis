# Open Science, in brief

* What we've been teaching you (automating data analysis, using
  version control) is efficient *and* enables open science;

* Open Science is basically about opening up the *process* and
  *results* of science so that others can easily build on what you've
  done. This typically includes sharing **data and scripts**;

* If you post data and source code, you must specify copyright and license.

* I Am Not A Lawyer but: copyright is *who owns it*, license is *what
  can non-owners do with it*.  The copyright owner can specify the
  license and change the license at any time.

* Academic norms are: you own your data, the university owns your code.
  However, often the university will let you choose licenses if you are
  interested in making things available more widely.

* I suggest CC-BY for data and BSD for code; GPL is another code
  option.

* read [the "open science"
  link](http://dib-lab.github.io/2015-07-06-ucdavis/syllabus/git-04-open.html)
  for details on your licensing options.

* I am happy to talk at any time about this stuff!
